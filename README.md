# Let'sDo App – Project Plan

## Project Overview

**Goal**: The objective of this project is to develop a functional and somewhat polished web application prototype using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, and NodeJS). By the end of the semester, we aim to deliver a prototype that demonstrates core features and reflects the team’s learning outcomes in full-stack web application development.

### Team Structure

All team members are designated as Developers. Each team member is expected to participate in all aspects of the project lifecycle, including planning, design, coding, testing, and deployment. Additionally, all team members are responsible for communicating project decisions, technical choices, and process improvements.
